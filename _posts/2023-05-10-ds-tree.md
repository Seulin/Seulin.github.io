<!-- may contains internal and leaf nodes count
Complete binary tree, balanced binary tree, degenerate binary tree -->
## Binary Tree
- $N$ : number of nodes
- $L$ : number of leaf nodes
- $T$ : number of internal nodes
- $H$ : height $(>= 0)$
- Maximum $N = 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + ... 2^H = 2^{H+1} - 1$
(in the case of Perfect Binary Tree)
- Minimum $N = H + 1$
(in the case of Degenerate Binary Tree)
- Maximum $H = log2(N+1) - 1$ 
- Minimum $H = N - 1$ 
- $N = L + T$


1. Full Binary Tree
    - All the internal nodes have 2 child nodes.
    - Each node have 0 or 2 child nodes.
    - $L = T + 1$
    - Maximum $N = 2^{H+1} - 1$
    (in the case of Perfect Binary Tree)
    - Minimum $N = 2*H - 1$
    (when sibling of each node has no child)

2. Perfect Binary Tree
    - All the internal nodes have 2 child nodes.
    - All the leaf nodes are at the same level.
    - $H = log2(N+1) - 1$
    - $L = T+1 = 2^H$
